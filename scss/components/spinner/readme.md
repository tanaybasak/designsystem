### General Guidelines

The waiting experience is a crucial design opportunity. Although it may not be obvious what is occurring on the back-end, we can communicate clearly to reassure the user that progress is happening. It is a best practice to use a Spinner whenever the wait time is anticipated to be longer than three seconds. 

Size 

Spinners may be scaled down if the loading experience is contextual to a certain item on the page.
