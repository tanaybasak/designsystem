Password input fields provide a way for the user to securely enter a password. The element is presented as a one-line plain text input component in which the text is obscured so that it cannot be read by replacing each character with a symbol when typed. There is a reveal icon in the field to reveal the password in case the user wishes to ascertain the correctness of the password.
