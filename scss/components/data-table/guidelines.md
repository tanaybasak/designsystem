The data table component is designed in a way for additional functionality to be added on to fit your team's needs.

The basic data table is shipped with a base style, which includes:

- Borders, multi select, hover states and sorting.
- Optional zebra striping, row dividers instead.
- No Pagination, search or table toolbar.
- Multiple content densities, compact, default, tall.

##### Horizontal alignment of columns: 

All text within columns should be left-aligned, including headers. Variable numerical values (e.g. prices, percentages, etc.) and their column headers should be right aligned. Some numbers, such as port numbers, are left-aligned, as they represent discrete values that remain consistent over time.

##### Sorting:

Improve table usability by making data sortable. Clickable headers enable users to sort table data up or down. The specific attribute being sorted is accompanied by a caret icon. The caret will only appear on the column headers once that specific column is being sorted.
