## Data Table

A Data Table displays a list of information for the user to view or edit, while maintaining that the data is readable, scannable, and easily comparable. The basic data table is shipped with a base style, which includes borders, multi-select, hover state and sorting.

### General Guidelines

The data table component is designed in a way for additional functionality to be added on to fit your team's needs.

The basic data table is shipped with a base style, which includes:

- Borders, multi select, hover states and sorting.
- Optional zebra striping, row dividers instead.
- No Pagination, search or table toolbar.
- Multiple content densities, compact, default, tall.

#### Horizontal alignment of columns

All text within columns should be left-aligned, including headers. Variable numerical values (e.g. prices, percentages, etc.) and their column headers should be right aligned. Some numbers, such as port numbers, are left-aligned, as they represent discrete values that remain consistent over time.

#### Sorting

Improve table usability by making data sortable. Clickable headers enable users to sort table data up or down. The specific attribute being sorted is accompanied by a caret icon. The caret will only appear on the column headers once that specific column is being sorted.

### Spec file

There is no limit to the height of an open row; however, you must follow the padding specs given below. The width of an accordion varies based on the content, layout, and page design. The chevron icon is available on the iconography library page. Avoid any text within 16px / 1rem of the accordion's sides. Additionally, include padding between labels, body copy, and separation lines to allow breathing room between elements.
