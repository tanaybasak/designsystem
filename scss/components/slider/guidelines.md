- Sliders should generally not be used for ranges with less than 4 values, radio buttons are a better choice for that. 

- They are best used where there is a sliding scale and a slight difference in the input doesn’t affect the result.  

- They should not be used where the precision of the value is important (e.g. house numbers) 

- Sliders are very effective in touch screen inputs. They work well for mouse inputs also. They are not ideal for keyboard input, the associated textbox works better for that. 

- Sliders can be modified to be used for Likert scale or such qualitative purposes via additional formatting and labeling, they’re not suitable out of the box for such use.
