* Content Switchers have two main states: selected and unselected. By default, Content Switcher buttons are unselected with the selected state using a high contrast colour. 
* Hover states only apply to unselected buttons. 
* Content Switcher text should be set in sentence case, with only the first word in a phrase and any proper nouns capitalized.  
* The text should not exceed three words. 
* Content Switchers must have at least two options for the user to choose from. Each container that makes up the content switcher is equal in size. The width of a container is determined by the length of the longest container option text plus the 16 px / 1rem on both sides of the text.
