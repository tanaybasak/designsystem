The sidebar contains secondary navigation and fits below the header. It can be configured to be either fixed-width or flexible, with only one level of nested items allowed. Both links and category lists can be used in the Sidebar and may be present together.

##### Use a sidebar when:

- there are more than five secondary navigation items

- you expect users to switch between secondary items frequently
