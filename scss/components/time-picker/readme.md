## Time Picker 

Time pickers allow users to select a single or a range of times. 

Example of time-picker

### General Guidelines

- Time Pickers provide the user with a text input in which they can input hours/minutes. Additionally, they can be accompanied by an “AM/PM” selection and a time zone selection, which is styled as an inline select. 

- _Heading:_ If necessary, a heading can accompany a Time Picker to provide further clarity for the user. Use sentence-style capitalization (only the first word in a phrase and any proper nouns capitalized). 

### Spec file

- Labels and headings should be set in sentence case, with only the first word in a phrase and any proper nouns capitalized.
