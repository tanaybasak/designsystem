#####Actions:

- The actions within an overflow menu should be direct so users can quickly decide on an action.
- Actions that could cause a significant change to the userâ€™s data (delete app, delete service, etc.) are separated by a horizontal rule and live below the primary set of actions.
- Some actions may be displayed as disabled (rather than removing them) when they can be used under certain conditions.

#####Positioning:

Depending on where the Overflow Menu appears within the UI, the menu be left or right aligned so the Overflow Menu is clearly visible.
