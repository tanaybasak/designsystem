Tags at their simplest state is just a piece of text encapsulated in the capsule shape. Furthermore, they can contain:

- A close (X) button to remove the tag

- **Thumbnails:** for representative pictures or icons

- Icons for categorizing

- Color coded statuses

- Icon buttons to represent actions

In many cases tags can be added or removed from a context.

Sometimes tags can be clickable to behave like a toggle or draggable for ordering or categorization. Usually click-to-toggle tags are not removable.

Tags should generally not be used like buttons – they are not to directly represent an action that can be performed on click. However, they can be used to click to view more about the entity represented in it – though that behavior should be used sparingly.
