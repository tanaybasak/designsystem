- **Headings:** If necessary, a heading can accompany a set of checkboxes to provide further context or clarity. Use sentence case for checkbox headings.
- **Labels:** Use clear and concise labels for checkboxes. Be explicit about the action that follows when the checkbox is selected. Labels appear to the right of the checkboxes.
- **Click target:** Users can make a selection either by clicking on the checkbox directly or by clicking on its label.
