Number input labels should use sentence case, with only the first word in a phrase and any proper nouns capitalized.

##### States

**Active**

Number input should have a default number to start. The input should never be empty.

Help text appears below the label when the input is active. Help text remains visible while the input is focused and disappears after focus away.

**Error**

Error messages appear below the input field and are always present while invalid.

**Disabled**

Disabled state should have a “.not-allowed” cursor on hover.
