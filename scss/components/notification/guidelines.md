The notification component is used inline near the element about which the temporary information is being displayed.  

**Examples:** 

- A notification below a timepicker warning that the user has chosen a time which is late night in local time.  

- A notification of success below a submit button saying the form is successfully submitted. 

They can also be used to show permanent information that requires special attention.  

It is important to use the correct flavour of notification, don’t use warning format for positive information, don’t use success format for a general alert, etc. 

Notifications may or may not be dismissable, if they are dismissable, it is recommended to have a log of them somewhere accessible so that the user can recall the data if they accidentally closed it.
