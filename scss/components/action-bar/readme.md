## Action Bar

Action bars are used to perform batch actions on selected items. This component is generally used in conjunction with a data table, list of checkboxes or other multi-selectable components. To see an example of such usage please go to the relevant section of the pattern library.

Example of action-bar

### General Guidelines

- Use an action bar when there’s one or more action you can perform on a single or multiple selected items in a list or table.
- Avoid using action bar if there’s only one action and it can only be applied on a single selected item.
- The general pattern is to make the bar visible only when a selection is made, but it can be kept visible beforehand depending on requirements.
- Don’t use action bars for actions which can be used even when nothing is selected, use toolbars for it.
- The entire header area of each title is clickable which helps them expand or collapse the content below it.
