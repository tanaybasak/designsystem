- Buttons are used primarily for actions. Examples include **Add**, **Save**, **Delete**, and **Sign up**. Each page should have one primary button, and a Return or Enter keyboard event should trigger it. Any remaining calls-to-action should be represented as secondary buttons. 
- Do not use buttons as navigational elements. Instead, use links when the desired action is to take the user to a new page. 
- Primary buttons always appear to the right. Secondary buttons appear to the left of the primary button. 
- When using multiple buttons, the primary button appears to the right and any secondary buttons appear to the left.
- Button labels should clearly indicate the action of the button. Use active verbs, such as **Add** or **Delete**. Use sentence-style capitalization (only the first word in a phrase and any proper nouns capitalized) and no more than three words for button labels. 
- For sets of buttons, use specific labels, such as **Save** or **Discard**, instead of using **OK** and **Cancel**. This is particularly helpful when the user is confirming an action.
