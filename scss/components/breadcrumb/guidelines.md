- Breadcrumbs are not a replacement for primary navigation.

- You can use just one breadcrumb to show that the user is one-level deep.

- In this case, clicking the single, stand-alone breadcrumb would act as a Back button to lead the user to the previous screen.

- Place breadcrumbs at the top of the page.

- Use breadcrumbs to show the hierarchy, not history.

- Breadcrumb titles should be short but descriptive enough

- Do not use breadcrumbs for representing a multi-step process (use a progress indicator instead).

#### Multiple tiers 

If there are more than three levels, the home level and the last two levels are visible, with all the middle levels collapsed into ellipses and accessible from a dropdown.
