## Breadcrumb

Breadcrumbs help you view the path of navigation or contextual relationship between objects. They also offer a quick way of navigating backwards within a path or within a specific context.

Example of breadcrumb

### General Guidelines

- Breadcrumbs are not a replacement for primary navigation.

- You can use just one breadcrumb to show that the user is one-level deep.

- In this case, clicking the single, stand-alone breadcrumb would act as a Back button to lead the user to the previous screen.

- Place breadcrumbs at the top of the page.

- Use breadcrumbs to show the hierarchy, not history.

- Breadcrumb titles should be short but descriptive enough

- Do not use breadcrumbs for representing a multi-step process (use a progress indicator instead).

- _Multiple tires :_ If there are more than three levels, the home level and the last two levels are visible, with all the middle levels collapsed into ellipses and accessible from a dropdown.
