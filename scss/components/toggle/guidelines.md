- Heading: A heading may accompany a toggle to further clarify on the action the toggle will perform.

- Labels: Use labels with a toggle so the action is clear. Labels should be three words or less and appear on the side of a toggle.

- Language: Use adjectives rather than verbs to describe labels and the state of the object affected.

- Small toggle

- Small toggles are more compact in size, therefore they can be used in use cases such asâ€¯data tables.
