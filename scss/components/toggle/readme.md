## Toggle

Toggle is a control that is used to quickly switch between two possible states. Toggles are only used for these binary actions that occur immediately after the user “flips” the toggle switch. They are commonly used for “on/off” switches.

### General Guidelines

- Heading: A heading may accompany a toggle to further clarify on the action the toggle will perform.

- Labels: Use labels with a toggle so the action is clear. Labels should be three words or less and appear on the side of a toggle.

- Language: Use adjectives rather than verbs to describe labels and the state of the object affected.

- Small toggle

- Small toggles are more compact in size, therefore they can be used in use cases such as data tables.

### Spec file

Toggle labels should be set in sentence case, with only the first word in a phrase and any proper nouns capitalized, and no more than three words.
