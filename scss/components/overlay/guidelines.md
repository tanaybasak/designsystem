**Target**

- The overlay panel does not have any notch to indicate the target, please highlight the attached target with an active or hovered colour scheme.

- The option that lets the overlay move with the target is more resource intensive than the one which makes the overlay sticky

**Persistence**

- The overlay panel should be triggered on click and should be closeable either on blur or on a custom action placed inside the panel. The panel should not be displayed or erased on hover behaviour.

**Content**

- The overlay component can contain anything inside, buttons, text, tables, lists, trees, it stretches to contain the content.
