- Use accordions when you need to consume specific areas of content within a page or when vertical space is limited.
- Use accordions when there is enough content to condense. Avoid nested accordions because it increases the cognitive load for users.
- Avoid allowing multiple open panes if there is more content above and below the accordion.
- Users may have multiple accordions open at the same time.
- The entire header area of each title is clickable which helps them expand or collapse the content below it.
