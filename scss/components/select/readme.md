Example of select

### General Guidelines

- Select vs dropdown: While the Dropdown and Select components look similar, they have different functions.
- Use the Dropdown component to filter or sort content on a page.
- Use the Select component inside a form where users are selecting from a list of options and submitting data.
- Another important difference between the two components is the underlying code. The dropdown component can be styled as needed, while the select componentâ€™s appearance will be determined by the browser being used.
