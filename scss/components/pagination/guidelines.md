**Identify the current page:** Clearly identify which page the user is on by displaying the current page number. By providing context into how many pages there are in total (e.g., 1 of 4 pages), you can help provide clarity around the data displayed. 

**Provide various options for navigating:** Previous and next chevrons or links are the most useful way for the user to move forward or backward through pages of data.

**Page navigation:** Provide an inline select in which users can choose the page they wish to navigate to.

**Items per page:** Use an inline select within the pagination bar so the user can change the amount of data displayed per page.
