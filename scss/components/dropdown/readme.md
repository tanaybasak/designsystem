## Dropdown

Dropdowns present a list of options that can be used to filter or sort existing content.
They can also be used as menus. Their use as menus can be seen in tabs. At a smaller screen size, the tabs collapse into a dropdown.

### General Guidelines

- Dropdown versus Select: While the Dropdown and Select components look similar, they have different functions. Use the Dropdown component to filter or sort content on a page. Use the Select component inside a form where users are selecting from a list of options and submitting data.
- Another important difference between the two components is the underlying code. The dropdown component can be styled as needed, while the select component’s appearance will be determined by the browser being used.
- _Labels:_ Labels inform users what to expect in the list of dropdown options. Use clear labels for the dropdown trigger so that users understand the purpose. Keep the label short and concise by limiting it to a single line of text.
- _Dropdown options:_ Describe the dropdown option succinctly in one line of text. Never use images or icons within a dropdown. Avoid having multiple lines of text in a dropdown, but if text wrapping is necessary, limit it to two lines and an ellipsis (…) for overflow content. We recommend presenting the options in alphabetical order.
- _Interaction:_ By default, the dropdown displays a label when closed. An open dropdown appears on click rather than on hover. Open dropdown drawers should appear above all other UI elements. They can be dismissed by clicking outside of the dropdown item or on the parent element.
- Selecting an item from the dropdown will close the drawer and the selected option will replace the label.
