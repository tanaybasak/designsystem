# Guidelines for writting SCSS

- Prefer CSS variables over sass variables. 
- Create SASS variables only where you need to use them in the SCSS specific syntax. Such as : interpolation
- Take the decision â€“ is the property can be reuse more than once? If yes, create the variable
- Your reference point could be twitter bootstrap and other libs but do not copy the same code from the 3rd lib.
- Write the generic class, elements and css
- Do not control the text-transform from css
- The nesting should not exceed more than 4 levels
- Keep checking the generated CSS to see if the written SCSS code is bloating or not
- Follow the modular based development approach : create the SCSS file for the modules rather than writing whole code in 1 file. 
Such as : button(s) style should be the part of button.scss , typography in one file, if listing as different style 
then we can move the list styling from Typography.scss and create new file list.scss. 
- Mixins should be in one file : mixin.scss.
- One should follow the camelNameCase.
- If you are using map mention'-map' after the name of the map.
